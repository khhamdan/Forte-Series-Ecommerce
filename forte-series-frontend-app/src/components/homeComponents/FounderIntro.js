                <h2>Hi, I'm Alex Costa, The Founder Of Forte Series.</h2>
                <br />
                <br />
                <p>
                  If you do not know me, I'm a men's fashion & lifestyle
                  influencer with to date 3 million <br />
                  incredible followers. I have promoted many brands but still
                  found that there was something <br />
                  missing in the market that was safe, salon-quality and at a
                  reasonable price.
                </p>
                <br />
                <p>
                  The big brands in beauty largely ignore the male consumerâ€™s{' '}
                  behaviour and needs; the vast <br />
                  number of different options in the market alone can overwhelm
                  the average guy.
                </p>

                <p>
                  I wanted to bring guys a competent line of products that met
                  all of their needs and wants.
                  <br /> After years of product development, I created something
                  I was proud to put my name behind.
